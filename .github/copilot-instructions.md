# Copilot Instructions for prepOS-v1

## Project Overview
This project currently consists of a single HTML file: [../index.html](../index.html). It appears to be a minimal or starter web project. There are no other source files, build scripts, or documentation present.

## Key Knowledge for AI Agents
- **Single File Architecture:** All code resides in [../index.html](../index.html). There are no external scripts, stylesheets, or components.
- **No Build or Test Workflows:** There are no build tools, package managers, or test frameworks configured. All development is done directly in the HTML file.
- **No External Dependencies:** The project does not reference any external libraries or APIs.
- **No Project-Specific Conventions:** Standard HTML practices apply. There are no custom naming conventions, folder structures, or patterns.

## Actionable Guidance
- **Edit Directly:** Make all changes in [../index.html](../index.html). If adding scripts or styles, embed them within the file unless instructed otherwise.
- **Document Changes:** If adding new features or sections, use clear comments within the HTML to explain purpose and structure.
- **Expand Structure as Needed:** If the project grows, create new files or folders as appropriate, and update this instruction file to reflect new patterns.

## Example Pattern
```html
<!-- Section: Navigation -->
<nav>
  <!-- ...navigation code... -->
</nav>
```
